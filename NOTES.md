# Notes

This is a mess, my apologies. I'm not familiar with ParameterizedTest implementation, and I didn't look at the Basket implementation properly because of that, hence doing the discounts in the price calculations initially. As soon as I started doing BOGOF discounts, I realised I had the wrong mental model.

I'm going to do a branch, starting from scratch, giving myself a strict hour now that I'm not flapping quite so much. I didn't want to cheapen the test by pretending the bad approach had never happened.
